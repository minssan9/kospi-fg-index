# DART Batch Processing System - Production Integration PRD

## Project Overview
Integrate and deploy the completed DART (전자공시시스템) batch processing system into production environment for the KOSPI Fear & Greed Index application. The DART system is fully implemented and tested, requiring deployment configuration, monitoring setup, and integration validation.

## Background
The DART batch processing system has been successfully developed with comprehensive components:
- Complete collector implementation with DART API integration
- Full TypeScript type system (15+ interfaces)
- Batch service with queue management and parallel processing
- Database schema with 7 new models and optimized indexing
- Scheduler integration for automated daily/weekly collection
- REST API routes with rate limiting and validation
- Comprehensive testing suite with unit, integration, and performance tests

## Business Objectives
1. **Enhanced Market Analysis**: Capture all major corporate disclosure events for comprehensive sentiment analysis
2. **Automated Processing**: 24/7 monitoring of Korean corporate disclosures without manual intervention
3. **Real-time Integration**: Incorporate disclosure sentiment into Fear & Greed Index calculations
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce manual data collection and improve analysis accuracy
5. **Scalable Foundation**: Establish robust data pipeline for future expansion

## Functional Requirements

### Core System Integration
1. **Production Deployment**
   - Configure production environment variables (DART_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL)
   - Set up database migration for new DART schema models
   - Configure production logging and monitoring
   - Implement health checks and service monitoring

2. **Data Pipeline Activation**
   - Initialize automated scheduler for daily disclosure collection (weekdays 6:30 PM)
   - Set up weekly financial data collection (Sunday 2:00 AM)
   - Implement historical data backfill process
   - Configure batch job monitoring and alerting

3. **API Integration**
   - Deploy DART REST API endpoints (/api/dart/*)
   - Configure rate limiting and security policies
   - Set up API documentation and testing endpoints
   - Implement admin interface for batch management

4. **Monitoring & Operations**
   - Configure application performance monitoring
   - Set up error tracking and alerting systems
   - Implement operational dashboards for batch job status
   - Configure log aggregation and analysis

### Fear & Greed Index Enhancement
1. **Sentiment Analysis Integration**
   - Integrate DART disclosure data into sentiment calculation
   - Implement disclosure impact scoring (0-100 scale)
   - Configure weight adjustments for Fear & Greed algorithm
   - Set up trend detection for market-moving events

2. **Data Quality Assurance**
   - Implement data validation and cleansing processes
   - Set up duplicate detection and handling
   - Configure data completeness monitoring
   - Implement data retention and archival policies

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Production DART API credentials registration and configuration
   - Database scaling for increased data volume (10-50MB/month growth)
   - Server resources allocation (512MB+ memory for batch processing)
   - Network security and firewall configuration

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Configure concurrent processing limits (50-200 API calls/day)
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexing
   - Set up connection pooling and resource management

3. **Security & Compliance**
   - Secure API key management and rotation policies
   - Implement data encryption for sensitive corporate information
   - Configure audit logging for compliance tracking
   - Set up access controls for admin endpoints

### Reliability & Scalability
1. **Error Handling & Recovery**
   - Configure circuit breaker patterns for API failures
   - Implement exponential backoff retry strategies
   - Set up dead letter queue for failed job recovery
   - Configure automatic service restart policies

2. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Set up real-time monitoring for batch job status
   - Configure performance metrics collection (throughput, latency, errors)
   - Implement alerting for system failures and performance degradation
   - Set up capacity planning and scaling triggers

## Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics
- **Daily Processing**: Successfully process 500-2000 disclosure records/day
- **API Efficiency**: Stay within 10K daily API call limit (50-200 calls/day actual)
- **Processing Speed**: Complete daily batch in 5-15 minutes
- **System Reliability**: Achieve 99.5%+ uptime for batch processing

### Quality Metrics
- **Data Completeness**: Capture 95%+ of relevant corporate disclosures
- **Sentiment Accuracy**: Improve Fear & Greed Index accuracy by 10-15%
- **Error Rate**: Maintain <1% batch job failure rate
- **Response Time**: API responses under 200ms for data queries

### Operational Metrics
- **Automation Level**: 100% automated daily data collection
- **Manual Intervention**: Reduce manual data processing by 90%
- **Monitoring Coverage**: 100% visibility into system health and performance
- **Recovery Time**: System recovery within 5 minutes of failure detection

## Constraints & Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- DART API service availability and rate limits
- Production database capacity and performance
- Network connectivity and API access permissions
- Third-party monitoring and alerting services

### Technical Constraints
- DART API rate limit: 10,000 calls/day
- Database storage growth: 10-50MB/month
- Processing window: Business day schedule alignment
- Memory requirements: 512MB+ for concurrent processing

### Operational Constraints
- Production deployment window requirements
- Data retention and compliance policies
- Security audit and approval processes
- Staff training and documentation requirements

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Production deployment and basic monitoring
2. **Medium Priority**: Historical data backfill and performance optimization
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced analytics and reporting features

## Timeline Expectations
- **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Production deployment and basic integration
- **Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Historical data backfill and monitoring setup
- **Phase 3 (Week 3)**: Performance optimization and documentation
- **Phase 4 (Week 4)**: Final testing and go-live preparation

This PRD focuses on operationalizing the completed DART system rather than development, emphasizing deployment, monitoring, and integration aspects for production success.
